# Notes
## Stuff I had to look up
### I did these without a LSP. When I wasn't sure about something, or I had to look something up, I tried to make a note here.

- When does a HashMap method return option, and when an Entry?
- if I call 10.max(20), is this an in-place update? 
- Is there a std implementation for a binary search on a sorted vector, given some lambda?
- How to collect slices into a new vector? eg. in Python: ``a[:5] + a[10:]``
- What's the difference between append, extend?
- How do you initialise a HashMap? ie. without ".insert" notation, similar to ``let v = vec![1,2,3]``, just for hashmaps or hashsets
- What's the equivalent of ``printf("%3d", val);``?
- Which values can be used as keys when hashing? Which trait does this depend on?
