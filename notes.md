# Notes
## Stuff I had to look up
### I did these without a LSP. When I wasn't sure about something, or I had to look something up, I tried to make a note here.

- When does a HashMap method return option, and when an Entry?
- if I call 10.max(20), is this an in-place update? 
- Is there a std implementation for a binary search on a sorted vector, given some lambda?
